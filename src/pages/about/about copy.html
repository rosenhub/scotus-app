      <p>The Supreme Court of the United States, also known as SCOTUS, is the highest court in the country and consists of nine judges, otherwise known as Justices. It is one of the three main branches of Government.</p><br>
      <p>The Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and such number of Associate Justices as may be fixed by Congress. The number of Associate Justices is currently fixed at eight. Power to nominate the Justices is vested in the President of the United States, and appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p><br>
        
        <p>Article III of the Constitution further provides that "[t]he Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."</p><br>
